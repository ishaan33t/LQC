    <h2>KOTH: Knockback</h2>
    <p class="muted"><em>Stay on the island. Send everyone else flying.</em></p>
    <p class="muted">
      A round-based King-of-the-Hill brawler on Roblox. Queue up with the Sign Up button, then get
      teleported to the Main Island where your score climbs only while you’re inside the hill. Use a
      physics Slap tool to blast rivals into the void and keep your footing. When only one player
      remains on the hill, a 30-second cleanup runs and everyone resets for the next round. Warm up
      anytime on <strong>PracticeIsland</strong> without affecting score.

    <h2>Vampire Survivors — 3D</h2>
    <p class="muted"><em>A fast-paced, 3D Roblox roguelite where swarms grow, builds break, and bosses crash the party.</em></p>
    <p class="muted">
      Survive escalating waves in a Vampire Survivors–style arena, vacuuming up XP orbs to draft animated upgrade cards—from solid boosts to mythic, glowing picks—and stack busted combos of auto-attacks and aura weapons. Every 5 minutes a server-wide warning triggers a boss: a colossal red sphere at 5:00, then a blue titan at 10:00 that fires slow hulks and quick darts; the timer pauses for the fight, and each win cranks enemy caps and difficulty. Pop your Spirit zone to pull in nearby XP, dodge projectiles, and see how long you can last.
