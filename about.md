# About LQC

LQC (Low Quality Creations) is a Surrey‑based indie brand focused on rapid prototyping and playful, high‑effort game design.
We build in public, ship often, and value clarity over complexity.

## What we believe
- **Fun first.** If it isn't fun in 60 seconds, we iterate.
- **Readable code.** Future‑you should thank present‑you.
- **Juice matters.** VFX, SFX, and animation sell every click.

## What we ship
Roblox experiences, tools, and learning resources — from clickers and tycoons to arena survival and movement sandboxes.

## Journey so far
- Prototyped traversal in **Goat Parkour Training** (unreleased sandbox).
- Designed tycoon loops for **Big Bacon Tycoon**.
- Built systems and polish for **67 Clicker**.
- Developing our flagship **KOTH: Knockback**.
